# Edge Impulse inferencing on the Generic Node 

## Overview

This repository contains the minimal example code for running an Edge Impulse designed models on the TheThingsIndustry's [Generic Node](https://www.genericnode.com/docs/) 

## Prerequisites

* **Edge Impulse:**

Make sure you followed the [Continuous motion recognition](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/continuous-motion-recognition) tutorial, and have a trained impulse.

* **Generic Node:**

Install the following software [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) and import the [Generic Node Sensor Edition](https://www.genericnode.com/docs/getting-started/se-sw/) default projects with STM32CubeIDE.


## Cloning the base repository

We created an example repository that contains the STM32CubeIDE project. Clone or download this repository at [example-inferencing-generic-node](https://github.com/edgeimpulse/example-inferencing-generic-node).

## Deploying your impulse

Head over to your Edge Impulse project, and go to **Deployment**. From here you can create the full library which contains the impulse and all external required libraries. Select **C++ library**, and click **Build** to create the library.

Download the `.zip` file, extract it and copy the two following folders, `model-parameters` and `tflite-model` to `example-inferencing-generic-node/Core`.

> ℹ️ Public project
> 
> You can clone this public Edge Impulse Project to your account if you want to have the same parameters: [Edge Impulse project](https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/public/74846/latest)


**Downloaded Edge Impulse C++ Library:**

```
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── edge-impulse-sdk
├── model-parameters      <- Copy
└── tflite-model          <- Copy
```

**example-inferencing-generic-node repository:**

```

├── main.cpp
├── stm32wlxx_it.c
└── stm32wlxx_it.h
```

Now copy the full `example-inferencing-generic-node` folder to `generic-node-se/Software/app/` which contains the project examples from the Generic Node that you should have imported from the [Prerequisites](#Prerequisites).

Open STM32CubeIDE and import your new project:

* Click on **File -> Import**:

![import](assets/import.png)

* Select **Existing Projects into Workspace**:

![import-existing-project](assets/import-existing-project.png)

* Select your new project called `edge_impulse_inference`:

![select-project](assets/select-project.png)

* Open the `main.cpp` file and replace the following `features[]` buffer with the ones provided in your Edge Impulse project **Live Classification** view on the Studio:

```
float features[] = {
		// copy and replace raw features here (for example from the 'Live classification' page)
		};
```

![copy-raw-features](assets/copy-raw-features.png)

Build your project and flash it as you would do normally.

Now open a Serial Monitor and you should see the following output with your custom parameters:

```
Inferencing settings:
	Interval: 20 ms.
	Frame size: 300
	Sample length: 6 ms.
	No. of classes: 3
